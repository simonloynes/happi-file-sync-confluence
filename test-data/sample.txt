Sample Plain Text Document
==========================

This is a simple plain text document for testing plain text content sync to Confluence.

Key Points:
- No markdown formatting
- No HTML tags  
- Just plain text with line breaks
- Should be converted to basic Confluence paragraphs

This paragraph demonstrates how plain text is handled.
Multiple lines within the same paragraph should be preserved with line breaks.

This is a separate paragraph after a blank line.

Testing scenarios:
1. Plain text to Confluence storage format conversion
2. Paragraph separation handling
3. Line break preservation
4. Special characters: & < > " '

The sync process should wrap this content in appropriate Confluence storage format tags while preserving the basic structure and readability.
